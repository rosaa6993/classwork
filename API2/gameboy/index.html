        <p>An Italian plumber created by a Japanese artist somehow became one of the most recognizable characters on earth. But where did he come from?
Our story begins in the early 1980’s with Donkey Kong, a love triangle between a man, his pet gorilla and his girlfriend.
This game defined the platform genre with its main character: “Jump Man”. He could move left and right, climb ladders and jump – over obstacles or from one platform to the next. It was very different from major video games of the time.

While Nintendo of America was working on distributing the game, the owner of their warehouse headquarters showed up demanding the rent, which was late. That landlord’s name? Mario. The staff jokingly started calling Jumpman Mario, earning him a nickname. It eventually became his actual name.</p>
