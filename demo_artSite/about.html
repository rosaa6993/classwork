             The Others in Art considers itself to be a place that fuels diverse creativity, ignites the minds, and provides inspiration for those seeking a profession in arts, or simply to inspire. The Others in Art is dedicated to fostering a conversation between the past and the present, the established and the experimental. Our goal is to give exposure to voices not often heard or seen in the arts.
